py-perf-parser
==============

This parser is derived from the work v8 developers
did and was downloaded from the URL below in May 2012.

http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge/tools/ll_prof.py

I fixed it up to deal with newer versions of perf.data.

More information about the linux perf tool and files it generates is
available from:
